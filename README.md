## Description

This project is one of the checkpoints of the college discipline called "UI project works". The main feature of this project is its design. I created it all by myself using Figma. There were two variants of design to choose from so I picked the dark one because this version is more attractive in my opinion. However the project is still raw, but I've achieved my goal to create a cool design and I want to share it. All variants are also available through the link
