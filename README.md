## Description

This project is one of the checkpoints of the college discipline called "UI project works". The main feature of this project is its design. I created it all by myself using Figma. There were two variants of design to choose from so I picked the dark one because this version is more attractive in my opinion. However the project is still raw, but I've achieved my goal to create a cool design and I want to share it. All variants are available through the link https://www.figma.com/file/yUUESKEyi0aG1kkLH1cGDo/%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%84%D0%B5%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%B0-%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8F?node-id=0%3A1.
